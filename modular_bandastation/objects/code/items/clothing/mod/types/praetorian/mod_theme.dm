		Blueshields to more effectively respond to threats facing their charges. Beyond this and its stylish blue & black paint job, however, the Praetorian differs little \
		from its Shellguard roots, retaining its middling armor ratings and restrictive hardware. Even so, Nanotrasen is more than happy with the design, and has proceeded \
		with a full rollout of the suit to Blueshields across their corporate empire."
